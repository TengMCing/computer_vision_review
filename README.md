## Computer Vision Paper Review

This is the source code for [https://cv-review.patrickli.org](https://cv-review.patrickli.org).

Follow the evolution of computer vision research from the early days of convolutional neural networks to todayâ€™s state of the art transformer models. Along the way, you will explore core tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image generation.

The collection is continually updated, with each paper presented as a set of Quarto slides. While it is primarily a structured learning resource for myself, I hope others find it useful too.

Thank you for visiting and happy learning.
