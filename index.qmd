Explore the evolution of computer vision research from the early days of convolutional neural networks to the cutting-edge transformer models. Along the way you will find insights into key tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image generation.

This collection is continuously updated with papers presented as Quarto slides. It is designed primarily as a structured learning resource for myself but I hope you find it helpful as well.

If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions please let me know by reporting an issue here:

Thank you for visiting and happy learning.
